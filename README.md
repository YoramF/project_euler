This repository is my solutions to https://projecteuler.net/
I start working on this project when I retired from my work and System Architect. Programming was my passion, though, my carire took me to differnt direstions.
Now that I have the time, I decided to return to my roots and write C programs again and solve mathematical problems.
Not sure my solutions are the best ones, though, I do try to optimize them as much as I can.
I chose C language as it was my second programming language I learned (the first one was Pascal). C allows me to full control. And the fact that I am not tied to any 
programming restrictions I prefer to stay with C and not move to more modern programming languages.
